This repository contains tools for calculating the relative risk, temperature related virus die-off and expected number of infectious virus copies in waste water for SARS CoV-2.

File descriptions:

calc_relative_risk.py - calculates the relative risk of CoV-2 transmission from waste water spills for different countries.

calc_copies_per_L.py - estimates the number of copies of infectious SARS CoV-2 expected in waste water and waste water spills for different countries.

calc_copies_dieoff.py - example 24 and 48 hour virus temperature related die-off calculation for different countries

waste_water_spill_pathogens.xlsx - an Excel spreadsheet implementation of the calc_copies_per_L.py script. This is intended to be easily accessible and allow testing / further exploration of the parameters. Contains examples for low (0.1%), medium (1%) and high (10%) viable:non-viable virus ratios.
